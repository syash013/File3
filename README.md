Creating a Ludo game in Python involves designing a program that replicates the classic board game. It typically includes functionalities like creating the game board, managing player movements based on dice rolls, handling game rules (such as capturing opponent pieces, safe zones, and reaching the finish), and implementing a win condition. Python allows for graphical interfaces using libraries like Pygame for visuals, user interactions, and game logic implementation, enabling the development of an interactive and engaging Ludo game experience
